My philosophies as a programmer:
> Start early, start often
> Be comfortable with being uncomfortable

This is a simple program to in my favorite programming language, C++.
``` c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "enjoys baking, watching Youtube videos, and traveling";
    return 0;
}
```
