[Welcome to my README file](/README.md)

![Portrait of me](/me.png){:height="60px" width="100px"}

I am a 3rd year undergraduate at UCSD majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business. I am interested in <span style="font-family:Brush Script MT; font-size:4em;">Software Engineering</span> and <span style="font-family:Brush Script MT; font-size:4em;">Product Management</span> roles. I enjoy working with people to bring a vision to life. In the future, I hope to build ethical algorithms in the tech industry and innovate accsesible tools for people to use around the world. 

My philosophy in life:
> Be comfortable with being uncomfortable

This is a simple program to in my favorite programming language, C++.
``` c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "enjoys baking, watching Youtube videos, and traveling";
    return 0;
}
```
